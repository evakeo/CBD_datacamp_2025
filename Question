Question:
Phytocannbiniods are a group of similar compounds that are naturally occuring in cannabis plants. Many recognize the name THC or Tetrahydrocannabinol, as an psychoactive component in the cannibas plant, however, there are other compounds such as CBD, Cannabidiol, and CBG, Cannabigerol, that are non- psychoactive. Additionally the potenial bioactive effects these componds can have health such as gut health and metabolism are unknown. 
The purpose of this project is to evaluate the microbial membership, metabolomic capablities, and intestinal health in response to major, CBD, and minor, CBG, phytocannibiniods using a translocational mouse model colonized with lean or obese human microbiota. For the use of this data camp, we will be exploring the targeted metabolomics of the mouse plasmsa. In which phytocannbiniods, CBD and CBG, and the endocannbiniods, 1-AG, 2-AG, and AEA are quantiatively evaluated using Liquid Chromatrography Mass Spectrometery. 
Through this analysis in the data camp I hope to understand if the the treatment, CBD or CBG, significantly effects the phyto and endocannibiniod profiles.
